# JavaScript Calculator

This is a simple web-based calculator built with **vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. It is designed for **learning purposes** and demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and arithmetic logic implementation.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Decimal support
- Clear button to reset the calculator
